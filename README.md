How long the challenge took for you?
    The challenge itself took me about 5 hours total. This is due to a variety of factors. For starters, I had to work my normal job and try to code this challenge on the side. Also my personal laptop was destroyed during Hurricane Ida, so I had to completely set up a new environment on my girlfriend's computer. This itself took 3 hours. I am stopping now to try to get some sleep before work tomorrow. I aim to do at least an hour more on this to knockout some more bonus points. 
Whether you got stuck anywhere?
    I got stuck setting up my environment. It has been a while since I have had to do that lol. Still fun nonetheless. 
Notable design decisions you made?
    Notable decisions include compoleting the project without deploying due to time and technology constraints. I kept this project as simple as possible, and with more time and me not having a full time job during the day I would have made it look much nicer. I would love to explain more. Feel free to ask me anything.
